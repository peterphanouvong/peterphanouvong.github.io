    <button class="accordion">Disadvantages of Single Cycle</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The main problem with single cylce processors is its performance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each instruction that is run on a single cycle processor takes one clock cycle (CPI = 1)</li>
            <li>The length of this clock cycle depends on the longest intruction</li>
            <li>The longest instruction in lw which has to do the initial PC, Instruction Fetch, Registers, Mux and then it has the ALU execution, accessing Data Memory and write back.</li>
            <li>Each instruction must now run on a clock cylce time dependent on the length of time it takes for lw to execute.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>What is a Multi-Cycle Processor</h4>
        <p>
          The main things to note about the Multi-Cycle Processor are:
          <ul>
            <li>It has registers between the main stages of the processor</li>
            <li>One clock cycle for each stage</li>
            <li>Clock Cycle time dependent on the longest stage</li>
            <li>CPI depends on type of instruction. (R-type uses IF, RR, EX, WB which would be 4 clock cylces)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      
        <h4>Why is it better?</h4>
        <p>Since the CPI is smaller for instructions which require less stages, the average clock time for the instructions decreases (as opposed to a single cycle where all instructions are on clock cycle and execution time given by the longest instruction: lw).</p>
        <p>overall latency is reduced, thus performance is increased.</p>
